A mod for VRChat that asks you whether you want to enter a portal or not every time you enter one.

This mod also contains many checks for portal droppers, or people who use a mod that drops portals maliciously.
If the mod detects a portal dropper, it will give you the option of blacklisting the user until you restart your game.

You can also toggle the mod on and off and auto accept portals from friends, yourself, and one's placed in the world itself (by the creator).

Note: AskToPortal is NOT Portal Confirmation by 404. AskToPortal is simply a replacement for Portal Confirmation as 404 was banned from the VRChat Modding Group for making malicious mods and AskToPortal will NOT work in conjunction with Portal Confirmation.
